<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

  Cinema Web App is a simple web app that was created as a team project for *CodersCamp 2019*.
  The project's aim was to learn the basics of React.js and make apps for each backend and frontend and to enable communication between them.


### Built With
The website was created with:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

A REST API was made with Express.js in Node.js.
Finally we deployed both apps using [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and *mongoDB* database in the cloud. Obviously entire database has a wide data validation system. Moreover the app is adapted for future expansion.

The website looks like a typical cinema webstie. It offers you all the basic staff usefull while visiting any cinema. That's why you can easily check the repertoire, find any info about the movies or just buy a ticket for a specific screening. Moreover you can make an account and sign in whenever you want to access some additional content.
